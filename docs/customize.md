#Customizing Installed Modules
We strongly recommend that you not customize installed modules, but alas sometimes it is required.  You should consider the following before making custom modifications to modules.

##Gitter
Ask a question on our <a href="https://gitter.im/modern-mean">Gitter</a>.  Someone may have an idea on how you can implement your idea without a custom modification.

##Contribute
If this is functionality that you think the community would like, submit an issue on the proper repository and we can look into getting your suggestion added to the module.  We strive to make modern-mean the best and your ideas and contributions are always welcome.  Have a look at our <a href="contributing.md">contributing guide</a>.

##Fork the module you want to customize
If there is no other way to get your customizations, we recommend forking the module and installing it into modern-mean.  If you fork the module you want to customize, make your customizations, then you can easily install your forked module using:
```sh
npm install <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/users-material
```
Everything should work just as it did using the modern-mean/users-material repo.  You will be responsible for keeping your fork updated.
